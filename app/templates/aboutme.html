          <h4>The project</h4>
          <p>This project was developed as a capstone project for Galvanize's
            Data Science Immersive course. It allowed me to explore two of my favorite topics,
            deep learning (especially in the area of computer vision), and dogs (which are definitely
            the best).
          </p><p>
            This was my first attempt at training my own neural
            network, and I look forward to being able to carry these skills onto other deep
            learning projects, as well as general data science projects.
          </p>
