#To do list

Misc:  
Finish CNN lectures  
Read dog classification papers with SVM and stuff  

Moar data:  
Look at possibly scraping for additional dog data  
Look at more augmentation possibilities  
  
Preprocess:  
Redo data-set with cropping at bounding boxes  
Look at padding vs resizing vs keeping only x  
Look at centering and other possible stuff  

Model:
Look at adding/changing layers and activations  
Figure out how to output softmax values from predictor  
Maybe reduce category size? (Cop out)  
Figure out how to see "how" they models are wrong. Are more classes wrong then others?

Summary:  
Figure out a concise way to summarize that doesn't require pickling the model (not great for space)  
Figure out a good way to compare models visually  
KNN/heirarch the groups to see if there are like dog breeds that match historically. This would also make an awesome
visual.  

WebApp:  
Make one
