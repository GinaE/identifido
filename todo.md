#To do list
Look at:
AlexNet/VGGNet/GoogLeNet/Unet - Net frameworks  

Misc:  
Finish CNN lectures  
Read dog classification papers with SVM and stuff  

Moar data:  
Look at possibly scraping for additional dog data  
Look at more augmentation possibilities  
  
Preprocess:  
Redo data-set with cropping at bounding boxes  
Look at padding vs resizing vs keeping only x  
Look at centering and other possible stuff  

Model:
Try overfitting on small dataset (sanity check)
Look at adding/changing layers and activations  
Look at weight initializations (he_normal vs glorot_normal)
Batch normalization layers
Maybe reduce category size?
Figure out how to see "how" they models are wrong. Are more classes wrong then others? Ind accuracy metrics

Summary:  
Figure out a concise way to summarize that doesn't require pickling the model (not great for space)  
Figure out a good way to compare models visually  
KNN/heirarch the groups to see if there are like dog breeds that match historically. This would also make an awesome
visual.  

WebApp:
